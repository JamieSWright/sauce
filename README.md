Playwright end-to-end tests for the "saucedemo" web application. It verifies key user flows: logging in, adding an item to the cart, proceeding to checkout, entering shipping information, and completing a purchase with confirmation. Each test simulates a typical user action and checks the expected outcome.


## Requirements
- Node.js v18+
- Playwright


## Test Summaries

- **User can log in with valid credentials and is redirected to product catalog**  
  Verifies that a user can successfully log in and is taken to the inventory page.

- **User can add an item to the cart and see the cart count update**  
  Checks that adding an item to the cart updates the cart badge and the item appears in the cart.

- **User can proceed to checkout from cart page**  
  Ensures that the user can navigate from the cart page to the checkout page.

- **User can enter shipping info and proceed to overview**  
  Verifies that the user can enter shipping information and move to the order overview page.

- **User can finish checkout and see confirmation**  
  Confirms that the user can complete the checkout process and sees the order confirmation message.
